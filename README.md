============
##Highlights:
###1) Immersive Learning:
In our demo, we have totally 5 levels, covering 4 introductory levels on light reflection, light refraction and light division. And the 5th level is an advanced level requiring all complicated fraction calculation to win.

###2) Augmented Reality:
We used Vuforia Plugin for Unity to achieve the AR effects.

###3) Play board game with your phone!
With the help to AR, we can play board game with your phone. Put the board cards on the real-world desk, and scan the cards with your phone camera, a virtual world will respond to show up on your phone screen!

####Board Card Set:
*Level Card: Set the game scene and environment for current level
*Tool Cards:
  - Reflector: can reflect the incoming light beam
  - Refractor: can refract the incoming light beam
  - Divider (1/2): can divide the incoming light beam to half lights
  - Divider (1/3): can divide the incoming light beam to one third
  - Summation: can combine all the incoming light beams
